NAME
----

bson_uint32_to_string - fast conversion of an integer to a string


SYNOPSIS
--------

[source, c]
-----------------------
#include <bson.h>

void
bson_uint32_to_string (bson_uint32_t value,
                       const char  **strptr,
                       char         *str,
                       size_t        size);
-----------------------


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Converts _value_ to a string.

If _value_ is from 0 to 1000, it will use a constant string in the data section of the library.

If not, a string will be formatted using _str_ and _snprintf()_.
This is much slower, of course and therefore we try to optimize it out.

_strptr_ will always be set.
It will either point to _str_ or a constant string.
You will want to use this as your key.


ERRORS
------

No errors are defined.
