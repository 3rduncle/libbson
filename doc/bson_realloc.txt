bson_realloc(3)
===============


NAME
----

bson_realloc - a libbson wrapper around realloc


SYNOPSIS
--------

[source, c]
-----------------------
#include <bson.h>

void *
bson_realloc (void  *mem,
              size_t num_bytes);
-----------------------


DESCRIPTION
-----------

The _bson_realloc()_ function shall act just like the system realloc except that _abort()_ is called if there was a failure to realloc.

Note that a call to bson_realloc() with _num_bytes_ of _0_ will free _mem_ as expected by system realloc.


RETURN VALUE
------------

A potential new allocation or the existing if it could be reused. NULL is returned if _num_bytes_ is zero.
